Project Description: IIUC Courses Portal
Overview:
The IIUC Courses Portal is a web-based application designed for International Islamic University Chittagong (IIUC) students and faculty to manage and access course-related information efficiently.
Purpose:
This portal serves as a centralized platform where students can view course offerings, access course materials, check academic schedules, and manage their enrollment information. It streamlines the academic administrative processes for both students and faculty members.
Key Features (Typical for such systems):

Course catalog and curriculum information
Student enrollment management
Academic schedule and routine display
Course materials and resource access
User authentication and role-based access
Responsive web interface for mobile and desktop use

Target Users:

IIUC students seeking course information and enrollment
Faculty members managing course content
Academic administrators overseeing course management

Technical Context:
The project appears to be a full-stack web application, likely built to digitize and modernize the traditional course management system at IIUC, making academic information more accessible and manageable for the university community.
